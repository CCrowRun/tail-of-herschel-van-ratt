			<p>Sunlight flooded the park. The only fortress from the perfect summer day hid beneath the mailbox. Its steel underbelly didn’t defend from the breeze. While perfect to cool those in the sun, for Herschel Van Ratt the wind brought chills and taunting smells from the idyllic scene outside. People tossed treats to socially acceptable scavengers. Pigeons pecked at bread, tastebuds clueless to whether it was white, wheat, focaccia, or pumpernickel. And the squirrels. Rats in cognito, tails plump with fluff. <br><br>
			Herschel sat back on his haunches. The moment his bald tail hit the sun, a cacophony of screams, stomping feet, and “Rat! Kill it!” erupted. People hopped atop benches to throw things at him. Not edible things, but sharp or heavy things. Meanwhile, rodents of the squirrely persuasion and disease ridden pigeons wandered freely.<br><br></p>

			<p>	Herschel, however, didn’t dwell on injustice. He couldn’t explain why every day he wound up in the space under the mailbox. Or why he tempted his senses with a better life. He tolerated his own as an audience for the world outside.<br><br>
			He smelled it before he saw it. Orville Reddenbacher popcorn. The buttery decadence slid under the mailbox. He never tasted it before. Every day, he passed by the stand as he walked to his mailbox. In an instant his nose located the source. The couple sat on the bench, bright red bag rustling. <br><br>
			Then they tossed popcorn on the ground.<br><br>
			Pigeons and squirrels hurried to it like they would any other treat. Any other treat indeed. Any creature worth its weight in olfaction knew better. Don’t take risks. He nudged his nose out to drink the aroma. Risks never paid off. He crept, belly low. The sun warmed his bare tail. Alert to every foot nearby, he crept further. Popcorn glowed orange from the butter. Several kernels bounced away from the flurry of feathers and fur. Dashing forward, he snagged one. He clutched it to his chest, squeezing his eyes shut.<br><br>
			Nothing. No screams. No stomping. The couple laughed and tossed another handful to the birds and squirrels below.<br><br>
			Tentatively, Herschel nibbled the edge. Flavor flooded his mouth, igniting his tastebuds until the warmth of the sun and the sounds of laughter melted away. The texture was soft yet resilient. The crisp core crunched beneath his incisors. This was bliss.<br><br>
			“Rat!” the woman screamed.<br><br>
			Herschel froze, clutching the kernel. The pigeons ruffled the feathers on their necks before taking flight. The squirrels leapt into the air in neurotic surprise before taking to the trees. As the lone scavenger, the enormity of the park surrounded him. <br><br>
			A heavy leather shoe approached. Herschel dodged the foot. A tube of lipstick flew and missed. The screams continued, the man leaping from the bench in pursuit. Throwing himself into a holly bush, Herschel found asylum among its leaves. <br><br>
			Voices murmured outside. Feet approached. The couple took scared steps closer. When the bush didn’t leap out and consume them alive, they withdrew. Herschel released his breath. Climbing onto a branch, he pressed his belly flat to keep far from the holly barbs. <br><br>
			 “Heya, Hershey.”<br><br> </p>

		<img src="hvr-holly-bush-02.png" height="600px" alt="Herschel and Smitty in the bush.">

			<p>Herschel squirmed with surprise. A leaf snagged his tail, nicking it. <br><br>
			Smitty the squirrel popped his head through the net of nettles. Squeezing through, he dumped several kernels of popcorn on the ground. “You looked hungry.”  <br><br>
			Hopping from the branch, Hershel nibbled on a kernel. The magic had dissipated. Still, Smitty came bearing Orville Reddenbacher, therefore he was the vision of generosity and taste. Smitty wasn’t bad, for a squirrel. He had some rat-like ways of thinking that gave him an advantage, though he maintained some squirrely sensibilities. <br><br>
			With a sigh, Herschel said, “I’m thirsty, Smitty.”<br><br>
			“There’s a pretty good bird bath, if your balance is good.”<br><br>
			“No no no, Smitty, I thirst for finer cuisine, sunshine. I’m tired of shadows and garbage, I need freedom to explore new frontiers.”<br><br>
			Herschel couldn’t tell how much broke through. Smitty twitched his nose as he normally did when confused. “You’re kidding,” Smitty said. “Garbage is delicious. New every time.”<br><br></p>

		<blockquote>"Garbage is delicious. New every time."</blockquote><br><br>


			<p>Perhaps Herschel should have explained novelty wasn’t necessarily an improvement. Instead, he said, “It was cruel to give a rat such a mind in a body that incurs such fear.”<br><br>
			“You should be a squirrel.”<br><br>
			Herschel doubted the power of squirrel cognition. “Smitty.”<br><br>
			“Seriously, you should be a squirrel. What a difference one little tail makes.” Smitty paced the small area of nettle-free ground, switching his tail. “I can wander just about anywhere outside. Some people don’t like it, but it’s nothing like when you enter a room, Hershey. Nope, I just hop on around out there and it’s finer than sunshine!” He ended with a hop and smile that might have sold peanut butter with the right marketing team.<br><br>
			“Thank you.” Herschel snorted, chewing on the popcorn. “If only it were that easy, but I can’t simply… Hmm.”<br><br>
			“Hmm? Hmm what?” Smitty asked. “You’ve got thoughts all over your face, spit ‘em out.”<br><br>
			“Smitty, do you know how to sew?”<br><br></p>

			<p>Herschel caressed the silver polymer blend, fabric rippling over his claws. Inside, silk smoothed the rough underside of the faux fur. Weeks of creeping, thieving labor poured into this endeavor. Herschel had to gnaw his way through more plastic than he ever cared to digest. Several threads snagged, one wrinkle bumped up three quarters of the way down, but as a whole, Herschel held in his paws a fine fake squirrel tail. <br><br></p>

			<p>	Smitty bounced from one end of the mailbox to the other. “Y’sure that’s not Jerry’s tail?” he asked with confused horror. “He was squashed last week, but the tail looked okay.”<br><br>
			“Absolutely certain. That’s disgusting.” Herschel laid the tail flat on the concrete, stretched to its full glory. “No, this tail won’t rot around me, or smell like,” Herschel considered politically correct words.
			“Or smell like a different sort of rodent.”<br><br>
			Carefully, Herschel backed his own naked tail into the squirrel tail sleeve. Smitty fumbled with the satin bow to pull it tight as he could. After a few mistrials, Smitty stood back, and gaped.<br><br>
			“Well? How does it look?” Herschel asked, trying to look over his shoulder.<br><br>
			Smitty hopped to look at it from the side. “Whip your tail like this,” he said, waving his tail upright.<br><br>
			“A rat’s tail doesn’t whip, Smitty, it’s made for balance. It oscillates back and forth to retain my center of gravity.” Herschel rolled his shoulders to take a few careful steps. The tail, however, dragged behind him. <br><br>
			Smitty humphed. “So do squirrel tails. No one will think you’re a squirrel if you don’t raise your tail.”<br><br>
			Herschel had not considered that. Did his tail go that far? Focusing, he raised his tail “Higher,” Smitty coached. Herschel strained. “Higher.” Surely, he must be close now. His tail bent practically backwards. “Higher.”<br><br>
			“This is as far as it will go,” Herschel snapped.<br><br></p>

		<!--Picture of tail raised strangely -->

			<p>Smitty furrowed his brow. “I guess a squirrel might do that with its tail.” Noticing Herschel’s expression, however, he added, “That’s okay, humans aren’t too smart, they’ll think you’re a squirrel for sure.”<br><br>
			Though not the awe of his brilliance Herschel expected, it sufficed. This was, after all, unprecedented. He expected some criticism. Sunshine spilled outside of the mailbox. Herschel drew in a breath. A middle aged man sat on a bench, picking bits of sourdough free to toss to the park creatures.<br><br>
			“Y’ready Hershey?” Smitty clapped a paw on Herschel’s back.<br><br>
			Herschel’s nose broke the shadow first. Sun warmed his whiskers. Following the scent of sour dough, Herschel fought to relax. Amble like the other squirrels. The weight of his tail fought to fall flat. Smitty bounced beside him. “You’re supposed to jump,” he whispered <br><br>
			“Rats are magnificent jumpers.” Herschel leapt a gentle arc to prove it.<br><br></p>

		<blockquote>"Rats are magnificient jumpers!"</blockquote><br><br>

			<p>“Great! That’s perfect. Just keep doing that.”<br><br>
			Herschel prepared his muscles. He jumped. Again, jump. His backside burned with the effort. “I can’t,” Herschel exclaimed.<br><br> 
			“But you said rats are ‘magnificent’ jumpers.”<br><br>
			“Yes.” Just not all the time. The ache worsened with each successive jump, Herschel’s heart raced. His tail grew heavier and heavier. What felt like forever, however, ended within inches of the bread.<br><br>
			“Why hello there,” the man said good-naturedly. Herschel allowed his tail to drop, and approached the bread. The man tossed another bit. Herschel devoured one, while Smitty politely grabbed the other to store, another squirrel trait Herschel never understood. The bitter and soft taste was balm to his pain. When another piece was tossed, he dug into it too. Then, a passing child said, “Mommy mommy look, that squirrel is shedding its tail!”<br><br></p>

		<blockquote>"That squirrel is shedding its tail!"</blockquote><br><br>

			<p>“What?” the mother replied.<br><br>
			What? Herschel glanced over his shoulder. The tail slipped halfway down when he dragged it those last few inches. He tried to back into it, but the tie was too loose, and it slipped further.<br><br>
			“It’s just like a snake! Look, there’s the tail right there, and now it’s got a naked tail for the summer.”<br><br>
			“What?” the mother replied.<br><br>
			The mother screamed. The man stood up quickly, clutching his sandwich. Herschel whipped around to grab the polymer tail in his mouth.<br><br>
			“Look, look, he’s eating his tail!” the little boy shouted gleefully.<br><br>
			The adults cried with disgust. Herschel gripped his tail and ran, forgetting to hop. He ducked into the nearest bush. Fortunately, this one grew honeysuckle, smelled infinitely more pleasant, and was barb-free. Throwing the tail into the dirt, Herschel huddled in the shade. He shook, staring at his fake ticket to freedom.<br><br></p>

			<p>“Hershey?” Smitty popped in the top. The leaves quivered as he dropped down the branches.<br><br>
			“I’m not made to be a squirrel.” Herschel held his dignity by clenching his teeth.<br><br>
			“Duh, you’re a rat.”<br><br>
			“The tail was a mistake. A hideous aberration of nature that will undo me.”<br><br>
			The tail sprawled harmlessly on the ground. “That’s a little dramatic. It’s not gonna kill ya.”<br><br>
			Herschel released a long breath. Reasoning with a squirrel remained top of the list for “Herschel’s Pointless Ventures,” though making a squirrel tail came at a close second. He failed the mechanics. He didn’t foresee obvious physiological problems. Worst of all, every creature in the park witnessed the failure.<br><br></p>

		<blockquote>"He failed the mechanics. He didn’t foresee obvious physiological problems. Worst of all, every creature in the park witnessed the failure."</blockquote><br><br>

			<p>“What d’ya wanna do?” Smitty crawled over, settling. “You can hide in the bush and be a rat. You’re a… how would you say… magnificent rat.”<br><br>
			The slight British accent the squirrel attempted was pitiful. 	“Now you’re mocking me.”<br><br>
			“I’m not.” Smitty scratched his neck thoroughly with his back claw. “Maybe a little, but you’re the smartest garbage picker I ever met. You do a great job at being a rat, and you’d be a great squirrel with a little practice. You got a perfect tail, and it’s not gonna rot around you, like you said. I could keep it in my nest, and you could try being a squirrel whenever you feel like it.”<br><br>
			The tail sat in the dirt. White frosted the end of each hair, fading into black and then brown. It ruffled with startling contrast, each portion catching light differently. The silk slid smooth against his skin that first moment he put it on. “Smitty, it’s preposterous for a rat to parade around in a fake tail.”<br><br>
			“It’s kinda silly for rats to say preposterous, never stopped ya.”<br><br></p>

			<p>Hershel climbed up the fencepost. His limbs burned from jumping. They fought him as he dragged himself to the uppermost rung. Hauling himself onto the highest board, his aching tail gripped the post until he managed to balance. Though sharp, breathing came easier now. He dragged his tail up, and stretched onto his back.<br><br>
			Warmth baked his belly. Unlike the cold concrete below the mailbox, the board of the fence radiated heat. However, the wandering breeze brushed past, ruffling through the polymer-blend tail. Later, he could curl up in a shadow. He would relax, let his muscles melt to butter, and observe how the world worked from a quiet corner. There would be no risk of sunburn, certainly no reason to hop and swoop. But now, it was him, and the warm sun incubating his belly full of delicious treats.<br><br>
			“That is one happy rodent,” someone commented to their friend as they passed him by.<br><br>
			Yes, Herschel thought. One happy rodent indeed.<br><br></p>
